<!--*First you need a script line into your html code to load the api which loads the js definitions
when the page starts loading in the browser.  We're loading it asynchronously (async)
which means the rest of the page will render while the js api loads (which gives you 
more speed as it lets your page load without having to wait for javascript.  Then 
the callback function will execute when the api is done loading. if you're not
immediately using the API's functionality you could put the same instruction inside 
a function and call it only when you plan to use it.
maps.googleapis.com/maps is the endpoint that we're loading the js from
