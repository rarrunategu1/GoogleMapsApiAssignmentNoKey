    height: 100%; <!--this css says I want the map to be at 100% of the page-->

<!--add a google map simply by adding 3 things-->

<!--*Next you need a DIV Element with an id of map--> 
<div id="map"></div>

<!--Lastly we need more javascript-->
<script>
    var map; //map variable
    function initMap() { //this is an initialize js function to load the map
        //Constructor creates a new map - only center and zoom are required.
        //(document.getElementById('map') is saying where in the html to load the map
        //which will be the map div we created 
        //and what part of the world to show
        //center: {lat: 40.741359, lng: -73.9980244},
         //   zoom: 13
        map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
            center: {lat: 40.741359, lng: -73.9980244},
            zoom: 13 //you can go to level 21
        });
    }
</script>

<!--*First you need a script line into your html code to load the api which loads the js definitions
when the page starts loading in the browser.  We're loading it asynchronously (async)
which means the rest of the page will render while the js api loads (which gives you 
more speed as it lets your page load without having to wait for javascript.  Then 
the callback function will execute when the api is done loading. if you're not
immediately using the API's functionality you could put the same instruction inside 
a function and call it only when you plan to use it.
maps.googleapis.com/maps is the endpoint that we're loading the js from
Parameter v=3 means we're calling version 3 of the API-->
<script async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=MYAPIKEY&v=callback=initMap">
